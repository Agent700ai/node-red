# Product Context: Agent-Driven Workflow Automation

## 1. Business Rationale

The core value of Agent700 lies in the specialized capabilities of its AI agents. Currently, leveraging these agents requires manual, one-off interactions. This project extends that value by introducing automation, transforming single-purpose agents into components of a fully autonomous system.

By allowing business users to orchestrate agents in automated workflows, we move from a reactive tool to a proactive platform. This unlocks significant ROI for customers by automating repetitive tasks, enabling event-driven processes, and allowing for complex, multi-agent operations without human intervention. This strategic evolution will increase product "stickiness" and solidify Agent700's position as a central hub for AI-driven business process automation.

## 2. User Personas

We are targeting non-technical users who are focused on business outcomes.

### Persona 1: The Business Unit User (The "Implementer")

-   **Role:** Marketing Specialist, Operations Analyst, Customer Support Lead, Sales Manager.
-   **Technical Skill:** Low to Moderate. Proficient with business software (e.g., Salesforce, Google Analytics, Slack) but is not a developer.
-   **Motivation:** Wants to automate the repetitive, manual tasks that involve their specialized Agent700 agents. Their goal is to "set it and forget it," freeing up time for more strategic work. They need to trust that the automation is reliable and effective.

### Persona 2: The Manager (The "Overseer")

-   **Role:** Department Head, Team Lead, Business Unit Director.
-   **Technical Skill:** Low.
-   **Motivation:** Focused on team efficiency, compliance, and achieving business goals. They need visibility into what workflows are running, their success rates, and their overall impact. They are ultimately responsible for the business outcomes of the automations their team creates.

## 3. User Problems & Pain Points (The "Before" Scenario)

Without this feature, our users face significant limitations:

-   **Manual Repetition:** Users must manually trigger agents for every task (e.g., "I have to log in every morning and ask my 'Market Research Agent' to scrape competitor pricing.").
-   **Lack of Connectivity:** There is no way to chain agent actions together. A user cannot have a 'Scraper Agent' automatically hand off its findings to a 'Summary Agent'.
-   **No Event-Driven Capability:** Agents cannot be triggered by events in other systems (e.g., a new entry in a CRM, a new email, a new row in a database).
-   **High Time-Cost:** Repetitive agent interactions consume valuable employee time that could be spent on high-value strategic activities.
-   **Inconsistent Scaling:** It is difficult to scale the use of agents across a team in a consistent and reliable manner.

## 4. Desired Outcomes & Key User Journeys (The "After" Scenario)

This feature will be successful when our users can achieve their goals independently:

-   **Scheduled Automation:** "I want to schedule my 'Daily Sales Report Agent' to run every morning at 8 AM and post the summary to our team's Slack channel."
-   **Event-Driven Automation:** "When a new high-priority support ticket is created in Zendesk, I want our 'Triage Agent' to immediately analyze it and route it to the correct support engineer."
-   **Multi-Agent Chaining:** "I need to build a workflow where one agent scrapes customer reviews, a second agent performs sentiment analysis, and a third agent adds the results to a Google Sheet for our weekly meeting."
-   **Empowerment and Self-Service:** "I can build, test, and deploy these critical business automations myself in minutes, without needing to file a ticket with our IT department."
