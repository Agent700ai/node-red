# Project Brief: Agent700 Workflow Automation

## 1. Project Overview

The Agent700 Workflow Automation Project aims to integrate a powerful, canvas-based workflow automation engine into the Agent700 application. This feature will provide users with an intuitive toolset to automate a wide range of tasks, including data scraping, data analysis, API integration, and complex AI-driven workflows. The backend will be powered by Node-RED, with a custom-built frontend UI to ensure a seamless, branded user experience.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective is to empower Agent700 users to create, manage, and execute complex workflows directly within the platform. This will be achieved by:

- Leveraging Node-RED's robust backend for efficient and reliable workflow execution.
- Developing a seamless, custom-branded, canvas-style workflow UI.
- Ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance through integrated authentication.

## 3. Core Components

- **Node-RED Backend:** A scalable microservice deployment of Node-RED, exposing REST APIs for complete workflow management and execution.
- **Custom Frontend UI:** An intuitive, canvas-based workflow builder developed with modern web technologies (React + React Flow) and styled to match the Agent700 brand.
- **Authentication Integration:** Secure workflow management and execution using WorkOS SAML for enterprise-level user management and compliance.

## 4. Key Features

- **Canvas Workflow Builder:** A visual, drag-and-drop interface for constructing workflows.
- **Pre-built Workflow Nodes:** A library of nodes for common tasks like web scraping, data analysis, AI model integration, and API connectivity.
- **Secure & Compliant:** Workflows are secured with SAML-based authentication, and detailed execution logs are maintained to ensure SOC 2 compliance.
- **White-label Branding:** The UI will be fully customized to align with Agent700’s brand identity.

## 5. Expected Benefits

- **Enhanced Productivity:** Users can automate complex tasks through an intuitive visual interface.
- **Reduced Overhead:** Leverages Node-RED’s mature and extensive ecosystem, reducing development and operational costs.
- **Seamless Integration:** Fully integrated into the existing Agent700 platform, providing a unified and secure user experience.

## 6. Initial Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node-RED,
